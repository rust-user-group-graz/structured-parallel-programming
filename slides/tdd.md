# Rust Introduction

----

## Inception

* "Most loved" language in 2016, 2017 and 2018
* Initiated in the "The free lunch is over" era
* 1.0 release in 2015
* New point releases every 6 weeks

----

## Design Trifecta

* Safe
* Concurrent
* Fast

Pick all three!

----

## Design Choices

* A systems programming language
* For "programming in the large"
* Main influences from C++, Haskell and ML
* Static type system with local type inference

----

## Design Choices continued...

* Return values instead of exceptions
* Static automatic, deterministic memory management
* RAII - no garbage collector

---

# Safety Features

----

* No null pointers
* No dangling pointers
* No data races (partially true)
* Everything is immutable by default
* Safe by default, "unsafe" optional
* Compile-time concurrency safety (static analysis)

---

# Language Features

----

## Root influences

* ML-inspired match system
* Extremely helpful error messages
* Haskell-inspired type system

----

## Standard Library Features

* One standard library implementation on all platforms
  * Actually readable/debuggable!
* One compiler implementation
* Documented in code

----

## Build System Features

* crate - a build system and package manager
* crate.io - the package repository
* Unit testing integrated
  * Tests executed in parallel by default

----

## Meta-Programming Features

* Generics
  * Trait-constrained, not duck-typed
* Macros
* Procedural Macros
  * Rust Macros using Rust
* Compiler Plugins
  * Also managed as crates

---

# Fearless Concurrency with Rust

----

Rust was initiated to solve two thorny problems:

* How do you do safe systems programming?
* How do you make concurrency painless?

Central: Ownership/"Borrowing" â†’ compile-time, not runtime (=static analysis)

No compromises in terms of performance - zero-cost abstractions

----

## Ownership

* Every piece of data is uniquely owned
* Ownership can be passed
  * Passed by default!
* When owned data reaches the end of a scope, it is destructed
* Determined statically at compile time - even for references

----

## Borrowing

* Access can be borrowed
* You can borrow mutably once
* You can borrow immutably multiple times
* Exclusivity: No mutable and immutable borrowing at the same time
* Boil down to pointers at runtime

----

## Threads

* Use "spawn" to create new threads
* Move data structures into closures to pass ownership
* Message passing similar to Go
    Caution: Can deadlock when waiting on messages

---

# Structured Parallel Programming

----

## Basic principles

* Composable parallel programming patterns
* Avoid using explicit threads to avoid oversubscription
* Define *potential* concurrency as discrete tasks
* Usually implemented using a form of "work stealing"
  * Pioneered by Cilk(MIT Project), used in TBB

----

## Rayon

* Rayon = fake (C)Silk
* Work Stealing similar to Cilk
* Idiomatic Rust with all its safety guarantees

----

## Rayon Features

* par_iter
  * almost identical to the non-parallel version
* join
  * building block of par_iter implementation
* scope
  * more flexible than join to define parallel workload spans

----

## Performance in Examples

* Walk through Mandelbrot example in Rust and C++
  * Rust wins (probably due to better/newer compiler back-end vs Ubuntu 16.0.4 gcc)
* Show geth, cpp-ethereum, parity comparison
  * Rust wins (C++ client instable, slower - Go slower, more memory)
